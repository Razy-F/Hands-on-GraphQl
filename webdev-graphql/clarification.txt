graphQl is a specification built around HTTP for how we get and receive resources from the server normally we use REST when intreact with a server and restful endpoints and the HTTP POST GET DELETE PATCH , but graphQl gets rid of the whole idea of rest and all those different endpoints and gives us one single endpoint ( /graphql) and the way we determine what data we get back from that endpoint is based on the query that we send to that endpoint
